# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction
Use Supervised Learning to Predict Bank Customer Churn Rate

This project uses the bank customer dataset to predict the churn rate of customers.
It explored three possible models: a Logistic Regression Model, a Random Forest Model and a K Nearest Neighbor Model.
The models are fitted using the scikit learn library and the hyperparameters are tuned using grid cross validation.

All details of the project is contained in main.py, the used dataset is included here in bank_data.csv
