# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction
Use Supervised Learning to Predict Bank Customer Churn Rate

This project uses the bank customer dataset to predict the churn rate of customers.
It explored three possible models: a Logistic Regression Model, a Random Forest Model and a K Nearest Neighbor Model.
The models are fitted using the scikit learn library
